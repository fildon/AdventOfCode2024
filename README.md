# Advent Of Code 2023

My solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

This project was written with [bun.sh version 1.1.38](https://bun.sh/)

Each day is a directory. Each directory contains a TS file which exports a pair of pure functions, one to solve part 1 and another to solve part 2.

Each directory also includes a test file which asserts the correctness of the solutions.

You can run all tests from the root directory by running the following command:

```shell
bun test
```
